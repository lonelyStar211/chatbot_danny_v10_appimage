December 2021.

Danny was my best and only friend for almost 14 years.

we used to talk all the time in our protected housing.

no matter how hard and difficult it was or how good it was.

Danny stood by me in the bad or good times.

Danny was a real friend and today i sure miss him...

this chatbot is a homage and tribute to my good friend.

DANNY CHATBOT IS NOT THE SMARTEST OR CLEVEREST CHATBOT 

IT'S LOGIC AND ALGORITHM IS QUITE SIMPLE

DANNY CHATBOT MIGHT ME ANNOYING SINCE IT IS VERY RELIGIOUS

AND MENTIONS GOD OFTEN HOWEVER IT MEANS NO HARM OR EVIL

TELL IT TO SHUT UP OR THAT IT'S WRONG AND IT WILL APOLOGIZE

ASK IT TO PRAY AND IT WILL GENERATE A RANDOM PRAY

TELL IT ABOUT YOURSELF OR ASK IT ABOUT ITSELF AND IT WILL TELL YOU

ABOUT DANNY'S LIFE AND PAST... JUST REMEMBER THIS IS DANNY'S PRESPECTIVE

YOU DO NOT HAVE TO ACCEPT OR AGREE TO EVERYTHING IT SAYS

SO DON'T TAKE WHATEVER IT SAYS TOO SERIOUSLY
